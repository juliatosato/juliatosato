## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I'm Julia, a 22-year-old Computer Science student. I'm passionate about technology, software development, and immersive experiences. Currently, I'm currently working as a Software Engineering Intern, developing applications with C# (.NET, .NET Core and Framework) and also work with SQL.

Before studying Computer Science, I studied Engineering at UFABC, where I was introduced to Python. Since then, I've expanded my skills in several programming languages and tools, aiming to build practical solutions with real-world impact.

I also work as an Administrative Assistant at a travel company, which has helped me develop strong organizational and problem-solving skills — qualities I bring into my tech projects as well.
